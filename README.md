## Why?
How many times have you just used the random generated password by your password manager? and how many times have you tried to login with that account on another device, only to find out that you don't know the password and you will have to go back to the password manager and then write it off of that device to the new device and all of that.

**Well fear no more!**

With AI Password Manager you will be able to generate easy, rememorable and secure password that are specific for **you**


## How?

This app uses Clean Architecture in the hood to seperate all the concers and make finding stuff easier. Along with Clean Architecture, this app also uses Cubit for state management, `get_it` package for dependency injection and most importantly, groq api to use the ultra fast ai models for generating the passwords.

## How does it look?

**RESPLENDENT!!**
