## About
Passman is a password manager that integrates AI with managing and creating passwords, it not only creates specific easy to remember passwords, but it also can keep track of all your passwords so you won't have to remember them all!

## Developing
This app uses Clean Architecture to make the code production ready and make adding new features easier. This app also uses Bloc's subset "Cubit" for state management to connect the UI to the backend.

## Download
Download Passman for android from the github releases.
