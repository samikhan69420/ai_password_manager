## About
Passman is a password manager that integrates AI with managing and creating passwords, it not only creates specific easy to remember passwords, but it also can keep track of all your passwords so you will not have to remember them all!

 - [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) - for storing the passwords.
 - [Cubit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) - for state management.
 - [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) - for dependency injection.
